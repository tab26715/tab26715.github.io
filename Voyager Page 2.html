		<h3>Voyager Today</h3>
	<P>-	Upon the completion of their respective planetary exploration missions, both received mission extensions in 1989 to continue on and explore interstellar space<br>
-	Voyager 1 is now the most distant man-made object ever, crossing the heliopause on August 25th, 2012. It is currently 20.5 billion kilometers from Earth and travelling at over 38,000 miles per hour<br>
-       Both voyagers carry a golden record which contains information about humans and the Earth such as different languages, images, and even a interstellar map of Earth's position in the Milky Way should Voyager ever reach another intellegent civilization<br>
-       Currently represents the furthest man has ever gone, and will remain the most distant manmade object for the foreseeable future. It’s a testament to the longevity of human ingenuity and engineering
-       It will continue to function until 2025, when the radioactive decay generator running the probe's electronics dies </P>
