	<h3>The Program</h3>
<P>-    The voyager program is an ongoing scientific mission that oversees the operation of two robotic probes, Voyager 1 and 2<br>
	-	The probes were originally designated under the Mariner program as Mariner 11 and 12, however they were repurposed beginning in 1972 to explore Jupiter and Saturn, benefiting from a favorable alignment of the outer planets<br>
	-	Voyager 2 was launched on August 20th 1977, with Voyager 1 following on September 5th  
-    Both probes carried 10 scientific instruments that were positioned either on the body of the probe itself or out on extended booms where their readings would not be disturbed by the radiation from the generator or the electronics onboard </P>
